<p>The information on this page applies only to Hack Your Xyzzy servers running under the
<a href="//151.89.89.161">HackYourXyzzy domain</a>. Other servers may have other logging
policies. But assume that I haven't succesfully purged all the logging.</p>
<h1>Temporary logs</h1>
<p>There are two kinds of temporary logs.</p>
<h2>Server monitoring logs</h2>
<p>The original version logs which contain your IP address are collected and kept for a period of a few weeks, to assist
with monitoring the server. Apparently these logs do not correlate to your username and are not willingly
shared with third parties. But I haven't actively set up any logging.</p>
<h1>Permanent logs</h1>
<p>Game play details are kept on a permanent basis, to analyze which cards are the most and least
popular. The data in these logs may be made publicly available once an interface is completed, and
may be shared with third parties. These logs will never contain directly personally identifiable
information, however they do connect cards played in multiple rounds and games together, and include
geographic information no more precise than your postal (ZIP) code (and may be incredibly
inaccurate). Additionally, unless you opt-out on the Preferences tab, your card play history will be
tracked between multiple sessions.</br>
I will try to see how to remove this.</p>
<p>These data points are collected when you connect to a game server:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A temporary ID to correlate all cards you play during a session.</li>
  <li>A persistent ID to correlate your activity between different sessions. Opting-out in the
  Preferences tab will prevent this ID from being saved between sessions, causing a new one to be
  generated every time.</li>
  <li>Your rough geographic location, including city, state/province/territory, country, and postal
  code, to some degree of accuracy.</li>
  <li>Information about your web browser including its name (Chrome, Firefox, etc.) and current
  language (English, etc.).</li>
  <li>Information about your device including its operating system (Windows, Android, etc.) and type
  (phone, tablet, PC, etc.).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>At no point will anyhting be shared if I can help it.</strong></p>
<h1>Google Analytics</h1>
<p>The original version has Google Analytics, but fuck that! I've tried my best to remove it all.</p>
